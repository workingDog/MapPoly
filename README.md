# Draw a polygon on SwiftUI Map

This is my SwiftUI test code to draw an interactive polygon on a Map.

## Usage

### Add

To add a new polygon, click the `Add` button then click the map to add points. 

You need **at least 3 points** to form a polygon.

Click the `Add` button again to deactivate adding more points. 

**Tip**, it is often easier to just roughly put a number of points on the map, then edit the markers positions by dragging the polygon handles.  

### Edit

To edit a polygon, click the desired polygon handle on the map, it turns green.
Then drag the handle to the desired position. 

To exit editing, click on the same polygon handle again or the `Edit` button.

### Delete

To delete the polygon, click the `Delete` button.

### Todo

rotation and translation (Turn and Move)
