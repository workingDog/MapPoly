# Draw a polygon on SwiftUI Map

This is my SwiftUI test code to draw an interactive polygon on a Map.

## Usage

### Add

To add a new polygon, click the `Add` button then click the map to add points. 
Click the `Add` button again to deactivate it. 
**Note**, the edge bewteen the last and first points 
will be added automatically, no need to add the last point to close the polygon, 
just click the `Add` button again.

**Tip**, it is often easier to just roughly put a number of points on the map, then edit the markers positions by dragging the polygon handles.  

### Edit

To edit a polygon, click the desired polygon handle on the map, it turns green.
Then drag the handle to the desired position. 

To exit editing, click on the same polygon handle again or the `Edit` button.

### Delete

To delete the polygon, click the `Delete` button.
